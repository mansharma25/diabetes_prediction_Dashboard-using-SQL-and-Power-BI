# Patient Health Analytics Dashboard

This project demonstrates the creation of an **interactive Power BI dashboard** for analyzing patient health data. The dataset was sourced from Kaggle, processed using SQL Server, and visualized in Power BI.

## 🗂️ Dataset Overview
The dataset contains the following fields:
- `gender`: Gender of the patient.
- `age`: Age of the patient.
- `hypertension`: Binary indicator (0 or 1) for hypertension.
- `heart_disease`: Binary indicator (0 or 1) for heart disease.
- `smoking_history`: Categorized smoking habits (e.g., never, former, current).
- `bmi`: Body Mass Index (BMI).
- `HbA1c_level`: Hemoglobin A1c levels.
- `blood_glucose_level`: Blood glucose levels.
- `diabetes`: Binary indicator (0 or 1) for diabetes.

## 🔧 Project Workflow
1. **Data Extraction**: Sourced the raw data from Kaggle.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Used SQL Server to clean and preprocess the dataset.
3. **Data Integration**: Connected SQL Server to Power BI for data visualization.
4. **Dashboard Creation**: Designed visuals to uncover insights into patient health.

## 📊 Dashboard Highlights
- **KPI Cards**:
  - Total patient count.
  - Diabetics count.
  - Hypertension count.
  - Average BMI.
- **Donut Chart**: Diabetes distribution across age groups.
- **Bar Chart**: Diabetes counts by smoking categories.
- **Line Chart**: Average diabetes rates across age groups.
- **Pie Chart**: Diabetes correlation with heart disease.
- **Slicer**: Smoking habits filter for dynamic analysis.

## 💡 Key Insights
- Age and smoking habits have significant relationships with diabetes.
- A notable proportion of diabetic patients also have heart disease.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Add predictive analytics using machine learning.
- Explore forecasting for patient health metrics.
- Create custom tooltips for enhanced interactivity.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **SQL Server**: Data cleaning and preprocessing.
- **Power BI**: Data visualization and dashboard creation.
- **Kaggle**: Source of raw data.
